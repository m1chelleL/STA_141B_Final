Hello! Welcome to our STA 141B Final Project Github! This repository holds our statistical analysis (PDF) and code (.ipynb) for our project , "Decoding Cancer: Analyzing Cancer Factors by Country." Our analysis focuses on cancer incidence rates and explores the factors that may be associated to it across the countries worldwide. You will be able to access our statistical resaerch analysis via PDF and Jupyter Notebook file.

- Next, upload the two downloaded files into your Jupyter Notebook.
- Then, run through all the packages and imports needed.
- Continue running through all the code chunks for data scraping & visualization.
- Finally, interact with the plots & explore how they all vary.

Thank you!
